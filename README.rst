pyopenphoto is a python client for `OpenPhoto <http://theopenphotoproject.org/>`_ API.
It uses `requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_ and `requests-oauthlib <https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib>`_
and supports python versions 2.6/2.7/3.2/3.3/pypy-2.0

This is still in an early stage of development, do not use (yet)

Important
---------

This is an alternative client to the "official" one (`openphoto-python <https://github.com/photo/openphoto-python>`_),
it exports the same package openphoto, with a different API.
